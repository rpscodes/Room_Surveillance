# Room_Surveillance
Detect and take pictures and get notified of unauthorized strangers in your room. 
This program detects if someone turns on the light in your room and takes their pictures. 
It also notifies you an SMS about the unusual activity in your room.


This code can be repurposed to be used with a motion sensor to extend the application. With a combination of light and motion you'll be able to catch all the suspicious activity in your room. Note: This repo doesn't contain the motion sensor code.
